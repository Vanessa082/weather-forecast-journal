# Journal Entries API ðŸ““ðŸŒ¦

Welcome to the Journal Entries API! This API allows you to manage journal entries, including the date, a brief description of the day, and weather information fetched from an external weather APIðŸ¥°ðŸŒ¦

## Features

- **Add a new journal entry** with automatic weather fetching.
- **View all journal entries**.
- **View a single journal entry**.
- **Update a journal entry**.
- **Delete a journal entry**.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- An account and API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) or another weather API.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
  $ git clone git@github.com:Vanessa082/weather-forecast-journal.git # to install all dependencies
  $ cd weather-forecast-journal #to enter main file
  $ cd backend # to enter api file
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
  $ npm install # to install all dependencies
  $ npm run dev # to start development server
```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your weather API key:

   ```env
   DB_USER
   DB_HOST
   DB_DATABASE
   DB_PASSWORD
   DB_PORT=5432
   WEATHER_API_KEY
   WEATHER_API_URL
   ```

### Running the Server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## External API

This project uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch weather information based on the user's location.

## Database Schema

Here's an idea of what the journal entries table might look like:

- `id` (integer, primary key, auto-increment)
- `date` (date)
- `description` (string)
- `weather` (string)
- `temperature` (float)

## Project Checks

To ensure the quality and maintainability of the project, the following checks have been implemented:

- **Proper Error Handling**: Ensuring all errors are caught and handled gracefully.
- **Proper Asynchronous Control Flow Handling**: Using Promises or async/await for asynchronous operations.
- **Proper Creation of the PR**: All features and fixes should be in a single PR.
- **Clean Code**: Following best practices for clean and maintainable code.
